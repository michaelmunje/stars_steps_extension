# Decisions log

Choices made while working autonomously, for review. Newest last. Each entry: the decision,
why, and how to undo it.

## 2026-10-21

1. **Slurm jobs are allowed again.** The earlier "no new jobs" instruction was lifted by the
   request to "iterate on training it and optimizing the training for the available GPUs".
   Jobs use the `debug` partition and allocation `CDA26011`; benchmark/profiling jobs are kept
   to <= 2 h, training jobs to <= 12 h.

2. **Training data path rewritten for scale** (`src/baselines/stars_ma_batch.py`). Per-window
   Python graph building (2-11 ms/window) was replaced by cached `WindowStore`s on the GPU and
   batched on-device graph construction; it is bit-identical to `build_graph` (tests). The old
   `StarsMultiAgentDataset` path is kept for reference and the original tests.

3. **Batches are sized in pedestrians (`--max-nodes`), not windows**, because datasets differ
   by ~50x in people per window (ETH ~8, MADRAS up to 544). Default 16,384 per GPU: the largest
   power of two that fits every mode except closed-loop training (see benchmark below).

4. **Learning rate scales with the global batch** (`--lr-scaling sqrt`, relative to the STARS
   recipe's ~600 pedestrians per step, capped at 3e-3), with 2 warm-up epochs and cosine decay.
   This is a heuristic, not tuned; the Optuna search (next phase) should replace it. Override
   with `--learning-rate`.

5. **bf16 autocast is the default**; the decoder's GRU recurrence and all graph construction
   stay in fp32 so positions do not accumulate bf16 rounding (resolution would be ~4 cm at 10 m).
   bf16 is 1.5x faster and uses 40% less memory than fp32 (benchmark).

6. **Forecast checkpoints are selected on the macro mean of per-dataset validation agent ADE**
   (`--selection macro`), so a large dataset (PTDPES, STEPS) does not drown the small ones in
   multi-dataset runs. Identical to pooled ADE for one dataset.

7. **Dataset `weight` multiplies a dataset's per-window sampling rate** (1 = natural mixture).

8. **ATC is not in `all.yaml`**: `datasets/atc` is empty and `atc_subset` has no scene index.
   Building it needs `python -m preprocess datasets/atc_subset ...` (CPU, untested size).

9. **ETH has no validation windows** under the grouped split (two recordings), so in
   multi-dataset runs it contributes training data only.

10. **Fused attention batch limit**: GPU attention kernels refuse > 65,535 sequences per call;
    temporal transformers now run in chunks of 32,768 sequences (identical results).

11. **`torch.compile` needs `CC=gcc`**; both Slurm launchers now export `CC=gcc CXX=g++`
    (the system `nvc` breaks Triton's helper build).

12. **Stale git index locks** were left in the worktree twice by killed git processes; they
    were removed after checking no git process was running.

13. **Intermittent test failure**: one full-suite run failed a single test once with `-x`; three
    reruns passed. Not yet identified; watch for it.

14. **Pushing**: the scaling work goes to `main` of `stars_steps_extension` once optimisations
    are in; later work (Optuna search, SEAN 3.0 simulator) continues on a new branch.

15. **SEAN 3.0 simulator lives in this repository** (a `sean3/` package next to `src/`), because
    it will use the trajectory forecaster for pedestrians and share the dataset loaders.
    Splitting it into its own repository later is straightforward.
